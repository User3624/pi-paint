Thanks for downloading Pi Paint! 

Pi Paint is my Pi Day project for my class, because we were out of ideas

Here is a quick guide on how to use Pi Paint:

1. Installation

Pi Paint is a Python based program allowing users to paint in the Pi symbol. Because it is Python based, you obviously need... Python. 
Download Python from: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Pi Paint also requires a few Python libraries to be installed. To install the libraries;
 1. Open the terminal or command prompt of the operating system you are using.
 2. Navigate to the Pi Paint directory
 3. Type "pip install -r requirements.txt"
Done! Pi Paint is now ready to use. To open Pi Paint, click on the "pi paint v1.2.py" file.
